## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration with Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to configure API URLs and versions. This allows you to run the UI in different environments without changing the source code.

### Step 1: Copy the development environment file
```sh
cp .env.dev .env.local
```

### Step 2: Edit .env.local to configure variables as needed
```env
# CryptoMesh API
VITE_CRYPTOMESH_URL=http://localhost:19000
VITE_CRYPTOMESH_API_VERSION=v1

# ShieldX API (Choreography)
VITE_SHIELDX_URL=http://localhost:20000
VITE_API_VERSION=v1
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
### Run development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server on http://localhost:5173/.

### Build for production:
```sh
npm run build
```
This command prepares the application for deployment by generating optimized files in the **dist** folder. Use this step only when the application is ready for production.
